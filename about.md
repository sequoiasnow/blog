Thoughts! is a simple blog that serves as a space to express the errant thoughts
of Sequoia Snow. All the thoughts and opinions expressed herein are my own,
though I hope that some of them may serve to motivate thoughts in others. After
all, I can't very well call the blog *Thoughts Factorial* without expressing
some kind of multiplicative growth.

Within this blog you'll find articles ranging form philosophy, math, and
programming to errant thoughts about the weather - all organized by date
alone. Search through them at your leisure.

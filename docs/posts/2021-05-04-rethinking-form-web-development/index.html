    <h2 id="web-applications">Web Applications</h2>
<p>Let’s take a little walk back into the day’s of 90s web development and talk about forms. Forms are those ubiquitous collections of fields which you fill out to sign up for a service, log in, or otherwise perform a function. They are the web’s analog to the physical forms you might send to order a book, or file your taxes.</p>
<p>Now, that’s a pretty familiar definition - we are all aware of forms, and the role they play in our daily web development. However, their role in recent years has taken somewhat of a back seat to the emergence of web applications. In a web application, forms are typically restricted to the role of signing up and logging in, and even then their submission is often subsumed by javascript, rather than typical server validation. The core of the application is likewise driven by javascript with only data persistence being relegated to the server. In this manner the progressive web app mirrors the structure of the native applicaiton, though it still uses the frameworks of html and css to render the content.</p>
<p>Taking this approach is not without some downsides however. For instance, since the web has no equivalent of packaged standard libraries, using a web app means downloading a massive bundle of basic resources required to run the actual application code. Fortunately their are mechanisms in place to cache these large resources, but that caching is largely useful only when a web application is regularly visited. Less commonly frequented sites are hamstrung by large loading times. Moreover, the introduction of so much bloat in the development of a non native framework means that, even as JavaScript interpreters become increasingly fast, the increase in code bloat means the perceived speed of a web page is often slower now than it was years ago.</p>
<p>Now, none of these factors are themselves a reason to avoid the use of JavaScript based web applications - their are many situations where they are quite simply the most efficient and elegant solution to a problem, social media for instance. But it does merit some consideration of <em>when</em> to reach for them. In the context of a site which does not handle multiple asynchronous inputs and constant user input, as social media websites do, it may very well be that a more traditional approach may do. Thus, let’s take a look at that older way…</p>
<h2 id="the-early-web">The Early Web</h2>
<p>Before the past decade when javascript took the world by storm, web development was a pretty regular concern. There was a server, which rendered a page of html. When a link was clicked or a form submitted the server would respond by sending back a new page of html. From this rather complicated applications were constructed, relying almost entirely on the submission of forms in order to collect the users input. One of the benefits of this approach was that server logic resided on, you guessed it, the server - which meant that their was no need to download complex frameworks to the client beforehand, they merely received some small <code>KB</code>s of website data that was quickly rendered to the client. As a result of this simplicity, and the incredible increase of processing power and network speed over the past decades, an website built on these older principles seems incredibly fast compared with the hulking monoliths of javascript served up today.</p>
<p>There are other benefits as well. Because forms were so ubiquitously used in early web development, many fundamental aspects of web development exist to ensure they are more user friendly and workable. Moreover, us users have become acclimated to the web / submission workflow, to the point where the client side validation provided by many javascript based apps actually seems unintuitive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classic examples include a field complaining that what you’ve entered isn’t an email after typing the first character, or a form which passes all client side checks being submitted only to be rejected because of some unforeseen error which is not made visible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The downsides, of course, are as you would expect. It is more difficult to build any type of <em>application</em> logic using only server side renderings, just as it is difficult to build a form based logic using JavaScript. However, in between there are a wide variety of uses for server based websites: blogs, document stores, event sign-up’s, money transfers, etc.. In such a project using a server side approach not only improves the projects performance, but can also induce confidence in an applications by adhering to a behavior pattern familiar to websites - banking applications are an excellent example.</p>
<h2 id="in-development">In Development</h2>
<p>Their are other benefits to serving up a server based webiste: there is no need to create a version-ed API as the html is by definition synced with its server, consequently their is no potential block between backend and frontend development. However, most importantly, the user interacts with an application in a way that is innately obvious, since it is the behavior the web was built to support. Of course, the added performance benefit doesn’t hurt…</p>
